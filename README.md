# py-neat-discriminators
An implementation of evolvable discriminators (as in http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/papers/szerlip_aaai15.pdf) using the python NEAT library MultiNEAT. It is general (does not use HyperNEAT and does not train on mnist as in the paper), but can be easily altered to do so.

Requires MultiNEAT (http://multineat.com) and SciPy.
